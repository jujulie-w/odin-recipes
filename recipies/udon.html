    <h1>Chicken Yaki Udon</h1>
    <img src="../img/udon.jpg" alt="Chicken Yaki Udon" width="450">
    <p>This delicious yaki udon stir-fry is similar to yakisoba, but it's made with thick, 
    white udon noodles and tossed with a much simpler sauce. Often used in soups, udon noodles are also delicious 
    fried — the texture is just awesome because they are chewy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces frozen udon noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ pound boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>½ cup carrot matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
        until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm olive oil in large saucepan or wok over medium heat. Add chicken and sauté until cooked through for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion, bell pepper, cabbage, carrots, and garlic and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour soy sauce over vegetables and chicken; sauté 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add udon noodles and toss well. Mix in gojuchang and ketchup, thoroughly combining to mix all the flavors. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
